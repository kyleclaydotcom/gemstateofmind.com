                <h1>Wintery One Night Getaway at Eagle Ridge Ranch in Island Park</h1>
                <p>I’m only able to tell this particular story because of my opportunity to meet Susan and Steve in a meeting about refreshing the website for Eagle Ridge Ranch, a fun getaway spot in Island Park, Idaho. They invited our team members to stay at the ranch to understand what the experience was like to better help us build the website to suit. Needless to say, I was quick to raise my hand.</p>
                <p>At my job, I’m thankful that I get to meet people from all different walks of life and help them build their business by designing logos and building websites. Sometimes I get to help them start from the ground up, and other times I get to help an existing company rebrand or refresh. I’m only able to tell this particular story because of my opportunity to meet Susan and Steve in a meeting about refreshing the website for <a href="https://eagleridgeranch.com/" target="_blank">Eagle Ridge Ranch</a>, a fun getaway spot in Island Park, Idaho. They invited our team members to stay at the ranch to understand what the experience was like to better help us build the website to suit. Needless to say, I was quick to raise my hand.</p>
                <div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mIeMaM_8BOA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
                <p>Our check-in was at 3 p.m., but we knew we’d want to adventure around beforehand so we hit the road from Idaho Falls around 9:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning. The forecast called for snow all day, and it did just that all the way to Island Park. The slush building upon the highway from lesser trafficked lanes made it dangerous to pass any cars. Luckily, Island Park is only about 80 miles away (roughly 1.25-1.5 hours of driving) so even if we got stuck in a line of traffic, it still wouldn’t take us forever to get there.</p>
                <p>We had scoped out a small trail on the way to Island Park, but as we drove past the road, it was only accessible by snowmobile. It seemed that many of the trails had this limitation, so we just drove straight to Eagle Ridge Ranch in hopes we could check in early and/or get their suggestions on a little adventure. They were very excited to have us on the ranch, and they had lots of ideas for us, so we were in luck.</p>

                            <p>Kyle was born, raised, and currently lives in Eastern Idaho. He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts in studio art and design with an emphasis in graphic design at the University of Idaho and now works as a full-time web designer in Idaho Falls.</p>
                            <p>He has spent the majority of his life in Eastern Idaho, but attending college up north and having friends scattered throughout Central Idaho, he has had the opportunity to experience a variety of Idaho landscapes. Running around the Greenbelt in Idaho Falls, kayaking under the Perrine Bridge in Twin Falls, and watching the Independence Day fireworks on Lake Coeur d'Alene are some of his favorite memories, but he still feels like he has barely scratched the surface of what Idaho has to offer.</p>
