                <h1>Now It Is Even Easier to Get Your Idaho State Parks Passport</h1>
                <p>There are a handful of ways to get your Idaho State Parks Passport, but what is easiest? You can get one anytime online, and that's usually pretty painless. You would probably be hesitant to even think of going to your local DMV office to purchase one. However, there is an easier option that seems to do all the work for you, and it costs the same amount of money.</p>
                <p>It turns out that my vehicle registration was about to expire in June, and I've been dreading the thought of going to the DMV. The only time I can go is during work hours, so I end up missing time at work for the long wait. Little did I know, the state sends out renewal forms via USPS prior to your vehicle registration expiration date. Along with that courteous reminder came this eye-catching little flyer:</p>
                <img src="idpr-passportflyer-opt.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>As if the flyer didn't sell me on acquiring my Idaho State Parks Passport, on the renewal slip there's a note that says "Idaho State Parks Passport: Add $10 with a 1-year renewal or $20 with a 2-year renewal."</p>
                <p>I think this is such a great marketing move by the State of Idaho. People are already paying over $50 for a 1-year vehicle registration renewal (over $100 for 2 years), so why not encourage them to pitch in that small amount and just have the passport mailed to them? You can just skip that specialty morning coffee a couple of times, and/or pass up that quick trip to Taco Bell for dinner to justify the cost. This way you're being healthier AND spending money on access to awesome outdoor activities across the entire state! All of that beats a trip to the DMV if you ask me.</p>
                <p>The coolest part? As of May 30, 2019 you can renew your Idaho driver’s license, identification card or vehicle license plates via the Drive Idaho website. While renewing your plates, it even asks if you want to tack on the extra $10/year for the Idaho State Parks Passport.</p>
                <p>According to the Idaho State Parks & Recreation website, some perks that come with your passport include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>unlimited day-use access to every Idaho State Park</li>
                    <li>your boat launch fees are covered within Idaho State Parks</li>
                    <li>you get access to great hiking, cycling, mountain biking, and Nordic trails</li>
                    <li>not to mention all the beautiful scenery and animals you can encounter along the way</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The only catch is that your passport will expire concurrently with your vehicle registration, so you'll have to re-up when the time comes to retain access to Idaho State Parks. That being said, the passport is assigned to specific vehicles and is not transferrable to other people/vehicles.

                            <p class="heading">Kyle Clay Richards</p>
                            <p>Kyle was born, raised, and currently lives in Eastern Idaho. He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts in studio art and design with an emphasis in graphic design at the University of Idaho and now works as a full-time web designer in Idaho Falls.</p>
                            <p>He has spent the majority of his life in Eastern Idaho, but attending college up north and having friends scattered throughout Central Idaho, he has had the opportunity to experience a variety of Idaho landscapes. Running around the Greenbelt in Idaho Falls, kayaking under the Perrine Bridge in Twin Falls, and watching the Independence Day fireworks on Lake Coeur d'Alene are some of his favorite memories, but he still feels like he has barely scratched the surface of what Idaho has to offer.</p>
